This is a simple, hands-on demo for exploring the basics of AlphaGenome, a deep learning model from Google DeepMind that predicts how genetic variants impact gene regulation—especially in non-coding DNA.

Using their public API, this script illustrates how to query AlphaGenome, visualize RNA-seq effects of variants, and annotate transcripts. It's designed to be beginner-friendly and expandable—you’ll find basic tools here to start exploring. In the future, I’ll be adding functions to handle batch predictions, allowing you to analyze hundreds of variants at once—ideal for large-scale studies or exploratory pipelines.
